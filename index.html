        <h1>Say goodbye to homeland</h1>
        <p>Growing up in China, I have experienced Chinese-style primary school, middle school and high school. In the summer of 2018, I got the opportunity to study abroad. After a year of online classes, I got on a plane to Canada in 2022 and said goodbye to my family.</p>

        <h2>Ottawa</h2>
        <p>My school is located in Ottawa, the capital of Canada. Although it is the capital city, the decoration of the city is not as prosperous as the neighboring Toronto and Montreal. But Ottawa makes me feel very comfortable, it's very leisurely to walk down the street every day, it's a slow city just like I like it.</p>

        <p>It is October now, which is the most beautiful period of maple leaves. Whenever I sit by the window, I can see the beautiful maple trees. Besides, the evening sun in Ottawa is also beautiful.</p>
        <h2>The college life</h2>
        <p>Now I am in my second year of university life, and I have experienced the first year of online course teaching. I am looking forward to the offline course very much. When I came to the campus, the fact also gave me a positive response, having the opportunity to communicate with classmates and teachers face to face, which made my college life more rich.</p>
        <p>Want to know more about my school? This is a little bit of Wikipedia:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ottawa">The school is co-educational and enrolls over 35,000 undergraduate and over 6,000 post-graduate students. The school has approximately 7,000 international students from 150 countries, accounting for 17 per cent of the student population.[14] The university has a network of more than 195,000 alumni. The university's athletic teams are known as the Gee-Gees and are members of U Sports.</blockquote>
        <p>Now I'm working on my degree in digital journalism. Fortunately, the professors are teaching interesting things, such as the web page I'm working on, and I'm very confident about my future school.</p>
